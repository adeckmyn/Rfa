Rfa

Alex Deckmyn, KMI-IRM, 2000 - 2023

This R package contains an interface for reading (and writing) files in the FA format (and related formats such as LFI and ECHKEVO) used (only) by the ACCORD forecast models. 
If you don't know what all that means, you don't need this package.

You need the *meteogrid* package installed first. That deals with visualisation and all handling of the data itself.
Rfa bears some resemblance to the Rgrib2 package. It can be used directly (as I have done for > 20 years) or via the more unified file reading in harpIO.

Rfa has no other dependencies than meteogrid.
